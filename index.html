                <p>Technology is all around us,most people use a mobile device everyday to access various kinds of apps or websites, others use laptops,desktops, and other forms of technology.
                    We use technology in various ways, like contacting a family member or friend, whether that be through a phone call or sending a quick text message. Other ways include, shopping,entertainment,and education.
                    Tech can also be complex. Developers work to create apps or websites to help society, for example, when it comes to the weather, we can typically open up a weather app to check the weather or recieve emergency alerts due to severe climate conditions. Tech can help various people get to safety when it comes to weather realted issues.
                </p><br>
                <q>Technology can be a source of tremendous optimism. It can help overcome some of the greatest
                        challenges our society faces, including climate change, famine, and disease.</q>
